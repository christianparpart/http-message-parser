# C++ HTTP message parser library
[![CI Build](https://github.com/christianparpart/http-message-parser/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/christianparpart/http-message-parser/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is purely for demonstration on how to implement an HTTP/1 (request/response/message) parser.
The API and implementation was an extraction from the x0 project into a single tiny library for demo reasons.
